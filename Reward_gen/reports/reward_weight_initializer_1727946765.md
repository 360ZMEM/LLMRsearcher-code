To design the reward function, we need to carefully balance the weights of the different components so that they reflect the priorities of the task objectives. The primary objectives are safety (avoiding collisions and border crossings), followed by performance (reducing data overflow and maximizing service), and finally energy efficiency. Below are five sets of weights for the reward components, each with a different emphasis or scaling factor. The first set aims for a balanced approach, while the subsequent sets explore different weightings by scaling certain parameters.

### Set 1: Balanced Approach
```python
w_collision = -50;  # High penalty to ensure collisions are avoided
w_border = -50;     # High penalty to ensure border crossings are avoided
w_service = 30;     # Reward for successful service, encouraging timely connections
w_overflow = -40;   # Penalty for data overflow, to prioritize preventing it
w_energy = -10;     # Moderate penalty for energy consumption, to encourage efficiency
```

### Set 2: Emphasis on Safety
```python
w_collision = -250;  # Stronger penalty to heavily discourage collisions
w_border = -250;     # Stronger penalty to heavily discourage border crossings
w_service = 30;      # Same reward for service as in balanced approach
w_overflow = -40;    # Same penalty for overflow as in balanced approach
w_energy = -10;      # Same penalty for energy consumption as in balanced approach
```

### Set 3: Emphasis on Performance
```python
w_collision = -50;   # Same penalty for collisions as in balanced approach
w_border = -50;      # Same penalty for border crossings as in balanced approach
w_service = 150;     # Stronger reward for service to encourage more connections
w_overflow = -200;   # Stronger penalty for overflow to ensure timely service
w_energy = -10;      # Same penalty for energy consumption as in balanced approach
```

### Set 4: Emphasis on Energy Efficiency
```python
w_collision = -50;   # Same penalty for collisions as in balanced approach
w_border = -50;      # Same penalty for border crossings as in balanced approach
w_service = 30;      # Same reward for service as in balanced approach
w_overflow = -40;    # Same penalty for overflow as in balanced approach
w_energy = -50;      # Stronger penalty for energy consumption to prioritize efficiency
```

### Set 5: Reduced Penalty for Safety, Increased Performance Focus
```python
w_collision = -10;   # Reduced penalty for collisions, allowing some flexibility
w_border = -10;      # Reduced penalty for border crossings, allowing some flexibility
w_service = 100;     # Increased reward for service to encourage more connections
w_overflow = -80;    # Increased penalty for overflow to ensure timely service
w_energy = -10;      # Same penalty for energy consumption as in balanced approach
```

These sets of weights are designed to explore different priorities within the task objectives. The balanced set provides a starting point, while the others allow for exploration of different strategies by emphasizing certain aspects of the task.
