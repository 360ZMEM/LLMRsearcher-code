Below are five sets of weight parameters for the reward function. The first set aims to balance the weighted values of the reward components, while the remaining sets involve scaling certain parameter values with a minimum step size of 5x.

```python
# Set 1: Balanced set
w_collision = -10;  # High penalty for collisions to ensure safety
w_border = -10;     # High penalty for border crossing to ensure safety
w_service = 10;     # Reward for successful service to encourage prompt response
w_overflow = -5;    # Penalty for data overflow to minimize missed opportunities
w_energy = -0.1;    # Small penalty for energy consumption to optimize efficiency
```

```python
# Set 2: Emphasizing safety
w_collision = -50;  # Strong penalty for collisions to prioritize safety
w_border = -50;     # Strong penalty for border crossing to prioritize safety
w_service = 10;     # Reward for successful service remains the same
w_overflow = -5;    # Penalty for data overflow remains the same
w_energy = -0.1;    # Small penalty for energy consumption remains the same
```

```python
# Set 3: Emphasizing performance
w_collision = -10;  # Penalty for collisions remains the same
w_border = -10;     # Penalty for border crossing remains the same
w_service = 50;     # Strong reward for successful service to boost performance
w_overflow = -25;   # Strong penalty for data overflow to boost performance
w_energy = -0.1;    # Small penalty for energy consumption remains the same
```

```python
# Set 4: Emphasizing energy efficiency
w_collision = -10;  # Penalty for collisions remains the same
w_border = -10;     # Penalty for border crossing remains the same
w_service = 10;     # Reward for successful service remains the same
w_overflow = -5;    # Penalty for data overflow remains the same
w_energy = -0.5;    # Increased penalty for energy consumption to prioritize efficiency
```

```python
# Set 5: Balanced with increased scale
w_collision = -50;  # Increased penalty for collisions to maintain balance on a larger scale
w_border = -50;     # Increased penalty for border crossing to maintain balance on a larger scale
w_service = 50;     # Increased reward for successful service to maintain balance on a larger scale
w_overflow = -25;   # Increased penalty for data overflow to maintain balance on a larger scale
w_energy = -0.5;    # Increased penalty for energy consumption to maintain balance on a larger scale
```

Each set of weights is designed to fulfill different priorities while maintaining a balance between the reward components. Adjustments in the weights reflect the emphasis on specific objectives such as safety, performance, or energy efficiency.
