To design the reward function for the AUVs, we must carefully balance the weights for each component to ensure that the overall reward aligns with the task's objectives. The goal is to make sure that the safety requirements are prioritized, followed by performance requirements, and finally, energy consumption optimization. We will provide five sets of weights, starting with a balanced set and then adjusting some parameters significantly to explore different scenarios.

### Set 1: Balanced Weights
In this set, we aim to balance the weights such that all objectives are considered equally, with safety taking a slightly higher priority.

```python
# Set 1: Balanced Weights
w_collision = -50;  # High penalty for collisions to ensure safety
w_border = -50;     # High penalty for border crossings to ensure safety
w_service = 30;     # Reward for successful service to encourage performance
w_overflow = -40;   # Penalty for data overflow to prioritize timely service
w_energy = -10;     # Smaller penalty for energy consumption to optimize efficiency
```

### Set 2: Safety Priority
This set emphasizes safety even more by significantly increasing penalties for collisions and border crossings.

```python
# Set 2: Safety Priority
w_collision = -250;  # Very high penalty to strictly enforce collision avoidance
w_border = -250;     # Very high penalty to strictly prevent border crossings
w_service = 30;      # Keep service reward moderate
w_overflow = -40;    # Maintain penalty for data overflow
w_energy = -10;      # Keep energy penalty low for efficiency
```

### Set 3: Performance Priority
This set focuses on optimizing performance, especially preventing data overflow and maximizing service success.

```python
# Set 3: Performance Priority
w_collision = -50;   # Moderate penalty for collisions
w_border = -50;      # Moderate penalty for border crossings
w_service = 150;     # High reward for successful service to maximize performance
w_overflow = -200;   # High penalty for data overflow to ensure timely service
w_energy = -10;      # Low penalty for energy consumption
```

### Set 4: Energy Efficiency Priority
This set prioritizes energy efficiency by reducing the weight of energy consumption penalties.

```python
# Set 4: Energy Efficiency Priority
w_collision = -50;   # Moderate penalty for collisions
w_border = -50;      # Moderate penalty for border crossings
w_service = 30;      # Moderate reward for service success
w_overflow = -40;    # Moderate penalty for data overflow
w_energy = -2;       # Very small penalty for energy consumption to promote efficiency
```

### Set 5: Extreme Performance and Safety
This set combines extreme penalties for safety violations with a high reward for performance, creating a scenario where only the best actions are rewarded.

```python
# Set 5: Extreme Performance and Safety
w_collision = -500;  # Extremely high penalty for collisions
w_border = -500;     # Extremely high penalty for border crossings
w_service = 300;     # Very high reward for successful service
w_overflow = -200;   # High penalty for data overflow
w_energy = -10;      # Moderate penalty for energy consumption
```

These sets provide different perspectives on how the AUVs can be incentivized to perform their tasks while considering safety, performance, and energy efficiency. Adjusting these weights allows for exploring various strategies in the reinforcement learning environment.
