Description in Natural Language: `self.N_AUV` AUVs are deployed in an area measuring `self.border[0]` Ã— `self.border[1]`. Each AUV must respond to data transfer requests from its corresponding target SN and navigate to the target device to prevent data overflow of SNs. After establishing a connection with an SN, the AUV will proceed to serve the next SN.

## Objectives of the task

Here are the main objectives to be optimized for the task: Safety requirements must be met first, followed by meeting performance requirements, and then optimizing energy consumption.

(Safety requirements) The number of both **collisions** and **border crossings** should be **reduced to zero**.

(Performance requirements) The number of data overflows **should be reduced to zero as much as possible**. This can be achieved by **responding promptly** to SNs and **increasing** the number of served SNs.

(Performance objective) The energy consumption of AUVs may be optimized (lower is better) without violating the **aforementioned** requirements.
